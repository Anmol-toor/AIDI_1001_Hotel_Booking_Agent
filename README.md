# AIDI_1001_Hotel_Booking_Agent


Project Overview: Hotel Booking Chatbot
I developed a hotel booking chatbot using Dialogflow to assist users with checking room availability, booking reservations, canceling bookings, and providing information on amenities.

Key Features:

Check Room Availability: Users provide room type, check-in, and check-out dates.
Book a Room: Collects user details to reserve rooms.
Cancel Booking: Handles cancellations with booking ID and user information.
Request Amenities: Provides info on services like Wi-Fi and shuttle.
Entities like RoomType, Amenity, and ServiceType were set up with synonyms to ensure accurate responses. The chatbot was thoroughly tested for smooth interactions and clear responses.
